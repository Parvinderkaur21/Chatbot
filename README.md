# Chatbot

This chatbot is based on customer service for a mobile company. 

I have created my own dataset consisting of all possible questions that a user can ask.

This is a simple chatbot which uses sklearn library, TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity.

It asks input from the user, transform the input into vector form and matches the input with the question column in dataset.
The chatbot prints the most similar answer from our dataset.
